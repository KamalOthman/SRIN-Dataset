# SRIN-Dataset
SRIN stands for Social Robot Indoor Navigation Dataset. It consists of 2D colored images for room classification (termed SRIN-Room) and doorway detection (termed SRIN-Doorway). The main feature of SRIN dataset is that its images have been purposefully captured for short robots (around 0.5-meter tall) such as NAO humanoid robots.
