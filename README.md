# SRIN-Dataset
SRIN stands for Social Robot Indoor Navigation Dataset. It consists of 2D colored images for room classification (termed SRIN-Room) and doorway detection (termed SRIN-Doorway). The main feature of SRIN dataset is that its images have been purposefully captured for short robots (around 0.5-meter tall) such as NAO humanoid robots. All images of the first version of SRIN were collected from several houses in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Main folders:
There are two main folders: 
1. SRIN-ROOM --> for room classification problem
2. SRIN-DOORWAY --> for doorway detection problem
